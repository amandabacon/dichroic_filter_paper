Raytum ~400 (at 45 deg: 368) nm SP filter in air (2024/07/05) no cuvette. Plot of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, and 70 degrees.

Coated side denoted by "TOP" written on filter. Subrtrate is sapphire. It is a sapphire 4 in diameter filter.

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 400 nm (0 degrees) and 368 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

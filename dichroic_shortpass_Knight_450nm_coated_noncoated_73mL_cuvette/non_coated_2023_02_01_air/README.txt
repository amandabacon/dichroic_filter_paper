Knight SP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air measurements.

Do note that these were done differently than the other measurements in water. Due to their shorter length, I had to add height, so the cuvette is raised by ~1" (cylindrical cuvette sits on the block from cuvette holder) or so (will measure later).

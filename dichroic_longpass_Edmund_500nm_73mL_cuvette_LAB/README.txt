Edmund 500 nm LP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and LAB measurements (2023/05/24). Plots of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. There is a single plot "Edmund_500nm_longpass_air_LAB_wave_50_percent," which is the wavelength corresponding to ~50% transmission as a function of AOI for air and LAB as well. There is another single plot "DF_LP_16_Edmund_500nm_air_LAB_cuvette_05_24_paper" that is included in the Dichroic Filter paper.

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 500 nm (0 degrees) and 492 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

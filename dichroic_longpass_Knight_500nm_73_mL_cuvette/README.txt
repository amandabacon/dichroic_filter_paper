Knight LP filter (same as all previous measurements) using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements.

The one called "Knight_longpass_500nm_air_tap_water_73mL_cuvette_09_06_Sam" was created to see if no cuvette air and 73 mL cuvette air measurements agreed or not. Sparked the need to re-do the no cuvette air measurements as a check. 

The one called "Knight_longpass_500nm_air_tap_water_73mL_cuvette_09_06_Sam2" was for your presentation at some point.

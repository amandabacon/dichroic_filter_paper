Measurements (2022?/09/16) using the same longpass absorbing filter as before (absorbing longpass 500 nm) and a 73 mL cylindrical cuvette. Plots of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees.

Do note, that while these are not labelled with the manufacturer, they might actually have been purchased from Edmund Optics.

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 500 nm (0 degrees) and 504 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

# Dichroic filter paper data 

This repository contains the following:

Absorbing longpass 500 nm Edmund filter plots using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette in air and tap water in "absorbing_longpass_500nm_73mL_cuvette."

The same absorbing filter above, but without the cuvette (only in air) in "absorbing_longpass_500nm_no_cuvette_air_comparisons." This includes comparison plots of the above as well. 

Raw data from the Lambda 850+ UV/Vis spectrophotometer in .CSV and .TXT formats in "csv_txt_files."

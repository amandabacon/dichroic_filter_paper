Raytum ~450 (at 45 deg: 410) nm SP filter in air (2024/07/05) no cuvette. Plot of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, and 70 degrees.

Coated side denoted by side without ID written on filter. Subrtrate is borosilicate glass (B33). It is a B33 77 mm x100 mm filter.

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 450 nm (0 degrees) and 408 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

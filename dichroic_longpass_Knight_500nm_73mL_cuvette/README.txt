Knight 500 nm LP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements. Plots of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. Plots of AOI as a function of wavelength and a color bar for fractional transmission (2D plot) are also included. There is a single plot "Knight_500nm_longpass_air_h2o_wave_50_percent," which is the wavelength corresponding to ~50% transmission as a function of AOI for air and water as well.

The plot named "Knight_longpass_500nm_air_tap_water_73mL_cuvette_09_06_paper" is included in the Dichroic Filter paper.

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 500 nm (0 degrees) and 454 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

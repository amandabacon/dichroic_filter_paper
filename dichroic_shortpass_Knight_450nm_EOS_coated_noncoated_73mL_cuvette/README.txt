Knight 50x50mm 450 nm (trapezoid) SP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements. Plots of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. There are two plots "Knight_shortpass_EOS_450nm_air(h2o)_wave_50_percent_coated_vs_non," which are the wavelength corresponding to ~50% transmission as a function of AOI for air and water as well.

Do note that these were done differently than the other measurements in air and water. While they are much bigger than our normal DF, I still a similar setup as before where the cuvette is raised by ~1" (cylindrical cuvette sits on the block from cuvette holder) or so (will measure later).

Note: Dichroic Filter paper uses 45 degree AOI for cut-on/-off value. Hence the difference between 450 nm (0 degrees) and 422 nm (45 degrees) in the titles.

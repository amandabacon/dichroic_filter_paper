Edmund 500 nm LP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements. Plots of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. Plots of AOI as a function of wavelength and a color bar for percent transmission (2D plot) are also included. There is a single plot "Edmund_500nm_longpass_air_h2o_wave_50_percent," which is the wavelength corresponding to ~50% transmission as a function of AOI for air and water as well. There are two tap water plots: one starts at 300nm and the other at 350 nm. There is another plot that removes higher AOI since they never cut-on.

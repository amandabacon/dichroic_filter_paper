Newer data measurements (2022/12/08) using the same longpass dichroic filter before (Edmund longpass 500 nm). These measurements compared to older measurements in air (no cuvette) and to the air and water measurements in a 73 mL cylindrical cuvette. Plots of fractional transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees.

Edmund SP filter (same as all previous measurements) using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements.

The "Edmund_shortpass_500nm_air_73mL_14mL_cuvette_comp.png" plot shows the comparison between the small rectangular cuvette and the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette, which is clear.

The "Edmund_shortpass_500nm_air_73mL_cuvette_comp_08_25_08_31.png" plot just shows the stability of the measurements over a period of a few days

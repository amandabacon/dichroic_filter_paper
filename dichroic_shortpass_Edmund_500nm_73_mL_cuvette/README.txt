The "Edmund_shortpass_500nm_air_73mL_14mL_cuvette_comp.png" plot shows the comparison between the small rectangular cuvette and the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette, which is clear.

The "Edmund_shortpass_500nm_air_73mL_cuvette_comp_08_25_08_31.png" plot just shows the stability of the measurements over a period of a few days

Edmund 500 nm SP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements. Plots of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. Plots of AOI as a function of wavelength and a color bar for percent transmission (2D plot) are also included. There is a plot "Edmund_shortpass_500nm_air_tap_water_73mL_cuvette_08_31_paper" that is included in the Dichroic Filter paper.

Newer data measurements (2022/12/08) using the same longpass absorbing filter as before (absorbing longpass 500 nm). Plots of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees.

Do note, that while these are labelled as "Knight," they might actually have been purchased from Edmund Optics.

Somewhat new data measurements (2022?/09/16) using the same longpass absorbing filter as before (absorbing longpass 500 nm) and a 73 mL cylindrical cuvette. Plots of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees.

Do note, that while these are not labelled with the manufacturer, they might actually have been purchased from Edmund Optics.

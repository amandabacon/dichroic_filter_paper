Knight 450 nm (square) SP filter using the 73 mL cylindrical cuvette for air and water measurements. Plots of percent transmission as a function of wavelength for AOIs: 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 70, and 75 degrees. There are two plots "Knight_450nm_shortpass_h2o(air)_wave_50_percent_coated_vs_non," which are the wavelength corresponding to ~50% transmission as a function of AOI for air and water as well.

Do note that these were done differently than the other measurements in air and water. Due to their shorter length, I had to add height, so the cuvette is raised by ~1" (cylindrical cuvette sits on the block from cuvette holder) or so (will measure later).

Some measurements were taken days to months apart. I think the best measurements are:

Air: coated_2023_02_02_air and non_coated_2023_02_01_air
Water: maybe coated_H2O_2023_03_10 and non_coated_H2O_2023_02_06

The H2O data provided in "csv_txt_files" are coated_H2O_2022_12_15 and non_coated_H2O_2022_12_15
